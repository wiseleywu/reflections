Q: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all
   your work local?
A: When you're working from a different location/computer
Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
   automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: There are times when the remote repository is being modified by other
   collaborators that have access as well. In those cases, you might not want
   every commit they made to be in your local repository - so it would be more
   beneficial to pull changes manually rather than automatically
Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
   use one instead of another?
A: Branch exists solely within a single repository, and it's used when you would
   like to work on new features/sections while maintaining the production
   quality of your existing code. Clone is used when you have an url of a
   repository and you would like to copy it to your computer locally. This could
   also be used when you would like to clone a local repository to another
   location locally. Fork is virtually the same as clone, and it's a term used
   exclusively within GitHub. Fork is used when you would like to continue the
   work on someone else's repository and like to give credit where credit is
   due - you will be able to fork (or copy) someone's GitHub repository into
   your own GitHub account (while retaining that repository's full history)
