Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: When initializing a repository, Git will search within it for files to track
   and build their origin point. This is required in order for Git to track the
   changes when creating the first commit on this new repository.
Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
   repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Staging area is the temporary location before committing files from working
   directory to the repository. I'm not sure the exact answer, but my guess is
   that it keeps the files write-locked before commit so that there won't be
   any last minute changes that will not be captured by the commit.
